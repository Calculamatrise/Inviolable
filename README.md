# Free Rider Lite
The first mod ever written for Free Rider HD. This started off as a theme for the web refresh. As I progressed in my journey in learning JavaScript, this mod became more and more advanced. However, due to my lack in ideas and motivation to continue writing updates and bug fixes for this mod, there is a better mod out there. Polygon's mod is, by far, the best mod I have seen, for this game. I would strongly recommend it to any new members.

## Features
Colour themes, Custom keybinds, Keyboard input display, Isometric dot grid
